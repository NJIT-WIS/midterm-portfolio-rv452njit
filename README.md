Welcome to Ravisankar Venkataraman Profile

The Explorer - Archetype

Those who like to experience the unknown, inquisitive, curious and do things different in a correct way.

Personally am so attracted to the stars, sky, even while walking am always looking up the sky since from my childhood, there is always some activity that is happening in the sky shooting stars, comets and so forth, its the most unforgiving massive area that's impossible to explore in one's life time (even cats if they have 9 live if at all). after my few nights sky gazing in dark sites, my perspective of life has changed a lot. Showing what we know and understood is not even a grain of sannd when looking and the vastness at expanse. Being explorer may not just be in this world but in this galaxy perhaps the universe eventually.
